    <div>
        <p>The next event on the horizon is the 2023 Homecoming Parade in September--date to be determined. You 
            are invited to perform at the parade as a part of the alumni band. There will be a 
            rehearsal the week of the parade for those who are local and want to come practice beforehand. 
            More information will be given to those who sign up using our google form or who provide information 
            on our contact page.
        </p>
        <p>The parade/pep rally are held in conjunction with the LHU homecoming game, so events may or 
            may not fall on the CMHS or Bucktail homecoming weekends. Our event offers the opportunity 
            for alumni to perform with the band in the parade and the next CM varsity football game 
            after the parade (usually the next day).

        <h2>Why Band?</h2>
        <p>"Why band...here's why...grab your coffee and read this...</p>

        <p>Let's assume, for simple math, we have a moderate to above average-sized marching band of 
            100 wind players, 20 percussion, 20 color guard, and two drum majors.  Now, while it seems 
            fairly straightforward...just play your music and march to various spots on the field...
            here's what REALLY is facing them.
        </p>

        <p>In an average production of 2 minutes duration, there will be somewhere in the neighborhood 
            of 300 notes played per student (some parts will be less, some more). For each note played, 
            the student must be responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correct fingering of note</li>
            <li>Proper tone quality</li>
            <li>Proper pitch</li>
            <li>Correct beginning articulation</li>
            <li>Correct release/ending</li>
            <li>Correct duration/timing</li>
            <li>Balance to other players</li>
            <li>Blend with other players</li>
            <li>Appropriate volume</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means at least 9 responsibilities per note times 300 notes...understand that sometimes 
            the student will not play during segments, so this is an average...2700 responsibilities per 
            student...times 100 players = 270,000 musical responsibilities for the wind section.
        </p>

        <p>Percussion will have more notes in snare/mallet parts, perhaps fewer in bass drum and accessory 
            parts, but on average, about the same number of musical concerns...substitute stick height for 
            pitch correctness, since it is not typical to tune drums as you go. This adds 2700 
            responsibilities...times 20 percussionists = 54,000 musical responsibilities for percussion.
        </p>

        <p>Color guard must be concerned with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Timing</li>
            <li>Hand positions</li>
            <li>Equipment angles</li>
            <li>Speed of spins</li>
            <li>Height of tosses</li>
            <li>Direction of spins...not to mention holding on to or catching equipment</li>
            <li>[Facial expression</li>
            <li>Poses/footwork -I added these to the existing article]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Number of counts roughly parallels musical notes, so assume 300 beats times 6 [8] 
            responsibilities, or 1800 [2400] items per guard member...times 20 members = 36000 [48000] more 
            things to do.
        </p>

        <p>So far, we are up to 360,000 [372,000] and we haven't touched marching. With marching, there 
            are at least the following considerations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Posture</li>
            <li>Direction of facing</li>
            <li>Instrument position</li>
            <li>Staying in step</li>
            <li>Staying in form</li>
            <li>Size of step</li>
            <li>Tempo</li>
            <li>Style of movement (Toes up? Knees straight? Shoulders square?)</li>
            <li>Control of space between members</li>
        </ul>
            <p>The drum majors must be on top of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tempo, beat pattern</li>
            <li>Dynamics</li>
            <li>Communication of style/energy to band</li>
            <li>Poise/showmanship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>or approximately 1200 items...times two majors...2400 more responsibilities.</p>

        <p>Keeping up so far? We're up to 664,800 [676,800] things that have to be done correctly...
            AND WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF THE SHOW!  Assume there are three 
            segments in the average show, our grand total jumps to a staggering 1,994,400 [2,006,400] 
            responsibilities on the members for a single performance.
        </p>

        <p>The next time you watch a marching band show, examine the level of expectation and delivery 
            that occurs with each student.  It is truly remarkable, and it will help you appreciate even 
            more the feeling that comes from a well performed show.  When they are done, stand up and 
            cheer their efforts...they are truly at the top of the 'responsibility pyramid' when 
            performing in marching band.
        </p>

        <p>Why band?  That's why..."</p>
